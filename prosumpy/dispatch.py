    """ Self consumption maximization pv + battery dispatch algorithm.
    The dispatch of the storage capacity is performed in such a way to maximize self-consumption:
    the battery is charged when the PV power is higher than the load and as long as it is not fully charged.
    It is discharged as soon as the PV power is lower than the load and as long as it is not fully discharged.

    Arguments:
        pv (pd.Series): Vector of PV generation, in kW DC (i.e. before the inverter)
        demand (pd.Series): Vector of household consumption, kW
        param (dict): Dictionary with the simulation parameters:
                timestep (float): Simulation time step (in hours)
                BatteryCapacity: Available battery capacity (i.e. only the the available DOD), kWh
                BatteryEfficiency: Battery round-trip efficiency, -
                InverterEfficiency: Inverter efficiency, -
                MaxPower: Maximum battery charging or discharging powers (assumed to be equal), kW
        return_series(bool): if True then the return will be a dictionary of series. Otherwise it will be a dictionary of ndarrays.
                        It is reccommended to return ndarrays if speed is an issue (e.g. for batch runs).
